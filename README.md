# Conductor

A CLI tool for defining and running multi-agent workflows with the GitHub Copilot SDK and Anthropic Claude.

[![CI](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/conductor/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Python 3.12+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Why Conductor?

Conductor makes multi-agent workflows — code review pipelines, research-then-synthesize flows, plan-then-implement loops — **repeatable, deterministic, and version-controlled**. You define your agents, their prompts, and the routing between them in a single YAML file:

- **Repeatable** — Same inputs follow the same path through the same agents.
- **Deterministic** — Routing uses Jinja2 templates and expression evaluation. First matching condition wins. No LLM in the orchestration loop, no tokens spent deciding what runs next.
- **Source-controlled** — Plain YAML files. Diff workflows in pull requests, version them with your code, run them the same way locally and in CI.

## Features

- **YAML-based workflows** - Define multi-agent workflows in readable YAML
- **Multiple providers** - GitHub Copilot or Anthropic Claude with seamless switching
- **Parallel execution** - Run agents concurrently (static groups or dynamic for-each)
- **Sub-workflow composition** - Reusable sub-workflows with templated `input_mapping`, usable inside `for_each` groups for dynamic fan-out
- **Script steps** - Run shell commands and route on exit code or parsed JSON stdout
- **Dialog mode** - Agents can pause for multi-turn conversation when uncertain
- **Reasoning effort** - Unified `reasoning.effort` (low/medium/high/xhigh) per agent or workflow-wide, translated to each provider's native API
- **Workspace instructions** - Auto-discover and inject `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.github/copilot-instructions.md` into every agent's prompt
- **Conditional routing** - Route between agents based on output conditions
- **Human-in-the-loop** - Pause for human decisions with Markdown-rendered prompts and clickable file links
- **Safety limits** - Max iterations and timeout enforcement
- **[Web dashboard](#web-dashboard)** - Real-time workflow visualization with interactive DAG graph, breadcrumb navigation into sub-workflows, live streaming, and in-browser human gates
- **Validation** - Catches stale template references, missing inputs, and undeclared dependencies before runtime

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -sSfL https://aka.ms/conductor/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://aka.ms/conductor/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer checks for [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (installs it if missing), fetches the latest release with pinned dependencies, and verifies integrity via SHA-256 checksum.

### Updating

`conductor update` checks for a newer release and tells you the one-line command to upgrade. Upgrades happen via the install script — the same script you used to install — because in-process self-upgrade is unreliable on Windows (the running Python interpreter sits inside the venv that needs replacing).

```bash
conductor update
```

To upgrade, run the install script in a **new shell** (not from inside a running `conductor` process):

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -sSfL https://aka.ms/conductor/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://aka.ms/conductor/install.ps1 | iex
```

Or skip the copy-paste with `--apply`:

```bash
conductor update --apply
```

`--apply` launches the install script automatically — on Windows it opens in a new console window so you can watch progress; on macOS/Linux it replaces the current process. Either way, the running `conductor` exits before the installer touches the venv, so file locks release cleanly.

The install script handles file-lock safety (process detection, stale-file cleanup, and on Windows a rename-fallback when the venv directory can't be removed), retries with backoff, and verifies the installed version after install. If your shell ever gets into a bad state from a failed update, re-running the install script is always the right next step.

Conductor periodically checks GitHub for newer releases (cached for 24 hours under `~/.conductor/update-check.json`) and prints a one-line hint when one is available. To silence the hint permanently — for example when you manage upgrades through a package manager or company-mirrored install — set `CONDUCTOR_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` in your shell environment. The check is also skipped automatically for non-TTY invocations, `--silent` mode, the `update` subcommand, and `--help` / `--version`.

### Manual Install

```bash
# Install from GitHub
uv tool install git+https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git

# Run the CLI
conductor run workflow.yaml

# Or run directly without installing
uvx --from git+https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git conductor run workflow.yaml

# Install a specific branch, tag, or commit
uv tool install git+https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git@branch-name
uv tool install git+https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git@v1.0.0
uv tool install git+https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git@abc1234
```

### Using pipx

```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git
conductor run workflow.yaml

# Install a specific branch or tag
pipx install git+https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git@branch-name
```

### Using pip

### Use the Conductor skill in Claude Code or Copilot CLI

This repo doubles as a single-plugin marketplace that ships the `conductor`
skill from `plugins/conductor/skills/conductor/`. The skill teaches the
assistant the workflow YAML schema, CLI commands, and execution model.

**Claude Code:**

```text
/plugin marketplace add microsoft/conductor
/plugin install conductor@conductor
```

**GitHub Copilot CLI** (`gh skill` requires GitHub CLI 2.91+, public preview):

```bash
gh skill install microsoft/conductor conductor
```

The plugin ships only markdown — no executables, hooks, or MCP servers — so
trust verification is straightforward.

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a workflow file

```yaml
# my-workflow.yaml
workflow:
  name: simple-qa
  description: A simple question-answering workflow
  entry_point: answerer

agents:
  - name: answerer
    model: gpt-5.2
    prompt: |
      Answer the following question:
      {{ workflow.input.question }}
    output:
      answer:
        type: string
    routes:
      - to: $end

output:
  answer: "{{ answerer.output.answer }}"
```

### 2. Run the workflow

```bash
conductor run my-workflow.yaml --input question="What is Python?"
```

### 3. View the output

```json
{
  "answer": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language..."
}
```

## Web Dashboard

Conductor includes a built-in real-time web dashboard that lets you visualize and interact with your workflows as they run. Launch it with `--web`:

```bash
conductor run workflow.yaml --web --input question="What is Python?"
```

![Web Dashboard](docs/img/web-dashboard.png)

**Key features:**

- **Interactive DAG graph** — Zoomable, draggable workflow graph with animated edges showing execution flow and conditional routing
- **Live agent streaming** — Watch agent reasoning, tool calls, and outputs stream in real-time as each step executes
- **Three-pane layout** — Resizable panels for the graph, agent detail, and a tabbed output pane (Log, Activity, Output)
- **In-browser human gates** — Respond to human-in-the-loop decision points directly in the dashboard, no terminal needed
- **Per-node detail** — Click any node to see its prompt, metadata (model, tokens, cost), activity stream, and output
- **Background mode** — Run with `--web-bg` to start the dashboard in the background, print the URL, and exit. Use `conductor stop` to shut it down later.

```bash
# Run in background — prints dashboard URL and exits
conductor run workflow.yaml --web-bg --input topic="AI in healthcare"

# Stop a background workflow
conductor stop
```

## Providers

Conductor supports multiple AI providers. Choose based on your needs:

| Feature | Copilot | Claude |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Pricing** | Subscription ($10-39/mo) | Pay-per-token |
| **Context Window** | 8K-128K tokens | 200K tokens |
| **Tool Support (MCP)** | Yes | Planned |
| **Streaming** | Yes | Planned |
| **Best For** | Heavy usage, tools | Large context, pay-per-use |

### Using Claude

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider: claude
    default_model: claude-sonnet-4.5
```

Set your API key: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...`

**See also:** [Claude Documentation](docs/providers/claude.md) | [Provider Comparison](docs/providers/comparison.md) | [Migration Guide](docs/providers/migration.md)

### Using a Local / Custom LLM Endpoint (Ollama, vLLM, Azure OpenAI, ...)

`runtime.provider` also accepts a structured object that routes the
Copilot SDK at any OpenAI-compatible / Azure / Anthropic-shaped endpoint.
Useful for local inference (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio) and managed
deployments (Azure OpenAI):

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    provider:
      name: copilot
      type: openai                          # openai | azure | anthropic
      wire_api: completions                 # completions | responses
      base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1
      api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY:-ollama}
    default_model: llama3.1                 # match your endpoint's model name
```

The structured form is opt-in: a bare `provider: copilot` keeps the
default GitHub Copilot routing. See
[`examples/copilot-local-llm.yaml`](examples/copilot-local-llm.yaml) for
the full example (including an Azure OpenAI variant) and
[Configuration Guide → Custom Provider Routing](docs/configuration.md#custom-provider-routing-ollama--vllm--azure-openai)
for environment-variable fallbacks, security notes, and validator rules.

## Workflow Registries

Conductor supports named workflow registries — GitHub repos or local directories
containing shared workflows. Configure a registry once, then run workflows by
short name.

### Quick start

```bash
# Add a registry
conductor registry add official myorg/conductor-workflows --default

# List available workflows
conductor registry list official

# Run a workflow from the registry
conductor run qa-bot                       # latest from default registry
conductor run 'qa-bot@official#v1.2.3'     # specific tag (quote the #)
conductor run 'qa-bot@official#main'       # branch HEAD (re-resolved on fetch)
```

See [docs/design/registry.md](docs/design/registry.md) for the full design.

## Examples

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/conductor.git
cd conductor
make dev
```

### Windows

On Windows, use `uv` directly instead of `make`:

```powershell
uv sync --all-extras    # instead of make dev
uv run pytest tests/    # instead of make test
uv run ruff check .     # instead of make lint
uv run ruff format .    # instead of make format
```

**Copilot CLI path:** Windows `subprocess` cannot resolve `.bat`/`.ps1` wrappers by name alone. If you see `[WinError 2] The system cannot find the file specified` when running workflows, set the full path to the Copilot CLI:

```powershell
# Find your copilot CLI
Get-Command copilot* | Format-Table Name, Source

# Set the path (use the .cmd variant from npm)
$env:COPILOT_CLI_PATH = "C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\npm\copilot.cmd"
```

### Common Commands

```bash
make test             # Run tests
make test-cov         # Run tests with coverage
make lint             # Check linting
make format           # Auto-fix and format code
make typecheck        # Type check
make check            # Run all checks (lint + typecheck)
make validate-examples  # Validate all example workflows
```

### Code Style

- [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting
- [ty](https://github.com/astral-sh/ty) for type checking
- Google-style docstrings
