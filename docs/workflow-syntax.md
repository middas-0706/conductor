## Workflow Configuration

The top-level `workflow` section defines metadata and behavior for the entire workflow.

```yaml
workflow:
  name: string                      # Required: Unique workflow identifier
  description: string               # Optional: Human-readable description
  entry_point: string               # Required: Name of first agent to execute

  metadata:                         # Optional: free-form key/value metadata
    tracker: ado                    # surfaced in the workflow_started event
    project_url: https://...        # CLI --metadata / -m can add or override

  instructions:                     # Optional: extra instruction files (paths)
    - ./docs/conventions.md         # prepended to every agent prompt
    - ./AGENTS.md                   # also auto-discoverable via
                                    # --workspace-instructions (see CLI ref)

  limits:
    max_iterations: 10              # Default: 10, max: 500
    timeout_seconds: 600            # Optional: Maximum wall-clock time (seconds)

  hooks:
    on_start: "{{ template }}"      # Optional: Expression evaluated on start
    on_complete: "{{ template }}"   # Optional: Expression evaluated on success
    on_error: "{{ template }}"      # Optional: Expression evaluated on error

  context_mode: accumulate          # accumulate | snapshot | minimal (default: accumulate)

  runtime:
    provider: copilot               # copilot | claude
    default_model: gpt-5.2
    temperature: 0.7
    max_tokens: 4096
    default_reasoning_effort: medium  # Optional: low | medium | high | xhigh
                                      # Workflow-wide default for reasoning /
                                      # extended-thinking effort. Inherited by
                                      # every provider-backed agent unless it
                                      # declares its own `reasoning.effort`.
                                      # See docs/configuration.md#reasoning-effort.
```

**Workflow metadata** is included verbatim in the `workflow_started` event and lets downstream consumers (dashboards, queue runners, observability tools) adapt without parsing the YAML. CLI `--metadata key=value` flags merge on top of YAML metadata (CLI wins on conflicts).

**Instructions files** are loaded once and prepended to every agent's rendered prompt. They are inherited by sub-workflows and persisted in checkpoints so resume continues to use the same instructions. Use the YAML `instructions:` list for workflow-pinned context, or pass `--workspace-instructions` on the CLI to auto-discover `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and `.github/instructions/**/*.instructions.md` (recursive; only files marked `applyTo: "**"` in YAML frontmatter are loaded — see the [Workspace Instructions section in the CLI reference](cli-reference.md#workspace-instructions) for full details) by walking from CWD up to the git root.

### Context Modes

- **`accumulate`** (default): Agents see all previous agent outputs
- **`snapshot`**: Agents see only the context at workflow start
- **`minimal`**: Agents see only their direct dependencies

## Agents

Agents are defined in the `agents` list. Each agent represents a unit of work.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: string                    # Required: Unique agent identifier
    description: string             # Optional: Purpose description
    type: agent                     # agent | human_gate | script | workflow | terminate (default: agent)
    model: string                   # Optional: Model identifier (e.g., 'claude-sonnet-4.5')
    
    prompt: |                       # Required for type=agent: Agent instructions
      Multi-line prompt with Jinja2 templates
      {{ workflow.input.field }}
      {{ previous_agent.output.field }}
    
    input:                          # Optional: Explicit input declarations
      field_name:
        from: "{{ expression }}"
        type: string                # string | number | boolean | array | object
        required: true
    
    output:                         # Optional: Output schema for validation
      field_name:
        type: string
        description: "Field purpose"
    
    tools:                          # Optional: Agent-specific tools
      - tool_name

    reasoning:                      # Optional: per-agent reasoning override
      effort: high                  # low | medium | high | xhigh
                                    # Overrides runtime.default_reasoning_effort.
                                    # Only valid on type=agent (rejected on
                                    # script, human_gate, workflow).
                                    # See docs/configuration.md#reasoning-effort.

    routes:                         # Optional: Routing logic
      - to: next_agent              # Agent name or $end
        when: "{{ condition }}"     # Optional: Route condition
```

### Human Gates

Human gates pause workflow execution for user input:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: approval_gate
    type: human_gate
    description: "Approve the proposed changes"
    
    options:                        # Required: List of choices
      - name: approve
        description: "Approve and proceed"
      - name: revise
        description: "Request revisions"
      - name: reject
        description: "Reject the proposal"
    
    routes:
      - to: implementer
        when: "{{ approval_gate.choice == 'approve' }}"
      - to: reviser
        when: "{{ approval_gate.choice == 'revise' }}"
      - to: $end
        when: "{{ approval_gate.choice == 'reject' }}"
```

#### Markdown in Gate Prompts

Gate prompts support full **Markdown formatting**. In the terminal, prompts are rendered with Rich Markdown (headings, bold, lists, code blocks). In the web dashboard, prompts render as styled HTML with interactive features:

- **Headings, bold, lists, code blocks** — all standard Markdown syntax is rendered
- **Tables** — GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) pipe tables are supported
- **File links** — relative file paths in the prompt (e.g., `./src/plan.md`) are auto-detected and rendered as clickable links that open in VS Code
- **URLs** — bare `http://` and `https://` URLs are auto-linked

```yaml
agents:
  - name: review_gate
    type: human_gate
    description: "Review the generated plan"
    prompt: |
      ## Review Required

      The planner produced the following artifacts:

      | File | Purpose |
      |------|---------|
      | ./output/plan.md | Implementation plan |
      | ./output/timeline.md | Delivery timeline |

      Please review the files above and choose how to proceed.
      See also: https://wiki.example.com/review-guidelines

    options:
      - name: approve
        description: "Looks good — proceed"
      - name: revise
        description: "Needs changes"
```

The auto-linkify processor is Markdown-aware: it skips fenced code blocks, inline code spans, and existing markdown links. File paths are validated against the workflow root directory (path traversal is blocked).

### Script Steps

Script steps run shell commands as workflow steps, capturing stdout, stderr, and exit code. Use them to integrate shell scripts, run tests, or invoke external tools without an AI agent.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: run_tests
    type: script
    description: "Run the test suite"           # Optional
    command: pytest                             # Required: command to execute (Jinja2 template)
    args:                                       # Optional: list of arguments (each Jinja2 template)
      - "{{ workflow.input.test_path }}"
      - "--verbose"
    env:                                        # Optional: environment variables for subprocess
      CI: "true"
      PYTHONPATH: "/app/src"
    working_dir: "/app"                         # Optional: working directory (Jinja2 template)
    timeout: 120                                # Optional: per-step timeout in seconds
    routes:
      - to: analyzer
        when: "exit_code == 0"
      - to: error_handler
```

**Output structure** — script step output is always available in context as:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `stdout` | string | Captured standard output |
| `stderr` | string | Captured standard error |
| `exit_code` | integer | Process exit code (0 = success) |

**JSON stdout auto-parsing** — if `stdout` is valid JSON _and_ the parsed value is an object, its fields are merged into the agent's output dict alongside `stdout`/`stderr`/`exit_code`. This lets you route on parsed fields directly instead of opaque exit codes:

```yaml
# Script writes to stdout: {"route": "planning", "issue_count": 3}
agents:
  - name: detector
    type: script
    command: pwsh
    args: ["-File", "{{ workflow.dir }}/scripts/detect.ps1"]
    routes:
      - to: planner
        when: "route == 'planning'"          # parsed field
      - to: scaler
        when: "issue_count > 100"            # parsed field
      - to: $end
```

JSON arrays and scalars are ignored (only objects merge). Non-JSON stdout is unchanged. Parsed fields shadow `stdout`/`stderr`/`exit_code` if a script outputs those as JSON keys.

**Declared output schema (strict mode)** — script steps can also declare an `output:` schema using the same syntax as LLM agents. When declared, conductor enforces a strict contract: stdout must be a single JSON object, the JSON gets merged onto the `{stdout, stderr, exit_code}` baseline, and the **merged dict** is validated against the schema. If any check fails the workflow aborts with a `ValidationError`:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: detector
    type: script
    command: pwsh
    args: ["-File", "{{ workflow.dir }}/scripts/detect.ps1"]
    output:
      route:
        type: string
        description: Which phase to enter next
      issue_count:
        type: number
    routes:
      - to: planner
        when: "route == 'planning'"
      - to: scaler
        when: "issue_count > 100"
      - to: $end
```

Strict-mode semantics:

- **stdout must be a single JSON object.** Non-JSON, empty stdout, JSON arrays, JSON scalars, and JSON followed by additional text (e.g. log lines) all fail validation with the underlying JSON parser error surfaced for diagnostics. Reserve stdout for the JSON payload and write logs to `stderr`.
- **Missing or wrong-typed fields fail validation.** Extra fields beyond the schema are kept in the output dict (the validator only enforces declared fields — the same loose-extras policy that LLM-agent structured outputs use).
- **Validation runs on the merged dict, not the raw JSON.** The `stdout`/`stderr`/`exit_code` built-ins are always present in the dict, with parsed JSON keys overlaid on top. Declaring `exit_code: { type: number }` asserts the built-in matches; if the script emits a shadowing JSON key (e.g. `{"exit_code": "ok"}`), the schema validates the shadowed value.
- **Failure semantics.** On schema-validation failure, the engine emits `script_failed` (not `script_completed`) and aborts the workflow. The failure event carries the captured stdout, stderr, and exit_code so dashboards and logs can show what the script actually wrote.
- **`output: {}` opts into strict mode with zero required fields** — useful when you want the JSON-object enforcement without listing fields yet.

Note: this is **structural** parity with LLM agents — the script must emit clean JSON to stdout. The JSON-recovery heuristics LLM agents use (extracting JSON from code fences, wrapping non-object payloads) intentionally do not apply to scripts, which are deterministic.

Omit `output:` to keep the lenient auto-merge behavior described above.

Access in downstream agents:

```yaml
prompt: |
  The test run produced:
  {{ run_tests.output.stdout }}
  Exit code: {{ run_tests.output.exit_code }}
```

**Routing on exit code** — use `exit_code` in route conditions to branch on success or failure:

```yaml
routes:
  - to: success_handler
    when: "exit_code == 0"           # simpleeval syntax
  - to: failure_handler
    when: "{{ output.exit_code != 0 }}"  # Jinja2 syntax
  - to: $end
```

**Restrictions** — script steps cannot have `prompt`, `model`, `provider`, `tools`, `system_prompt`, or `options`. Script steps also cannot be used inside `parallel` groups or `for_each` groups.

**Environment variable note** — values in `env` are passed as-is to the subprocess (they are not rendered as Jinja2 templates). Use `${VAR}` syntax in the workflow YAML loader if you need environment variable substitution in env values.

### Sub-Workflow Steps

Sub-workflow steps reference external workflow YAML files, enabling composable and reusable workflow building blocks. The sub-workflow runs as a black box — its internal agents are not visible to the parent.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: deep_research
    type: workflow
    workflow: ./research-pipeline.yaml   # Required: path to sub-workflow YAML
    input:                               # Optional: explicit input declarations
      - workflow.input.topic
    input_mapping:                       # Optional: per-call inputs to the sub-workflow
      topic: "{{ workflow.input.topic }}"
      depth: "{{ research_planner.output.depth }}"
    max_depth: 3                         # Optional: per-agent recursion cap
                                         #   (additionally bounded by global
                                         #   MAX_SUBWORKFLOW_DEPTH = 10)
    output:                              # Optional: output schema for validation
      findings:
        type: string
    routes:
      - to: synthesizer
```

**Key semantics:**

- The `workflow` field can be:
  - A local file path: `./research-pipeline.yaml` (resolved relative to the parent)
  - A configured registry reference: `qa-bot@team#v1.2.3` (see [Workflow Registry](design/registry.md))
  - An ad-hoc GitHub reference: `analysis@myorg/team-a#main` (owner/repo fetched directly from GitHub)
- Sub-workflow inherits the parent's provider configuration
- Sub-workflow output is stored in context and accessible via `{{ agent_name.output.field }}`
- Recursive composition is supported (sub-workflows can reference other sub-workflows) with a global depth limit of `MAX_SUBWORKFLOW_DEPTH = 10`
- Self-referential sub-workflows (a workflow referencing itself) are allowed; depth is bounded by the global cap and the optional per-agent `max_depth` field
- `input_mapping` keys are sub-workflow input names; each value is a Jinja2 expression evaluated against the parent's context. When `input_mapping` is omitted, the parent's `workflow.input.*` is forwarded to the sub-workflow as before

**Access sub-workflow output in downstream agents:**

```yaml
prompt: |
  The research findings were:
  {{ deep_research.output.findings }}
```

**Workflow reference types** — the `workflow` field supports three forms:

```yaml
agents:
  # Local file path (relative to parent workflow)
  - name: local_pipeline
    type: workflow
    workflow: ./shared/research-pipeline.yaml

  # Configured registry reference
  - name: registry_pipeline
    type: workflow
    workflow: qa-bot@team#v1.2.3

  # Ad-hoc GitHub reference (no registry setup required)
  - name: adhoc_pipeline
    type: workflow
    workflow: analysis@myorg/team-a#main
    input_mapping:
      data: "{{ workflow.input.raw_data }}"
```

The ad-hoc form (`workflow@owner/repo[#ref]`) allows cross-team workflow
composition without pre-configuring registries. See
[Ad-hoc References](design/registry.md#ad-hoc-references) in the registry design
doc for details on caching, authentication, and ref resolution.

**Sub-workflows in `for_each` groups** — `type: workflow` agents can be used inside `for_each` groups to fan out one sub-workflow run per item in the source array. Each iteration receives its own `input_mapping` evaluated against the loop variable, and emits its own `subworkflow_started` / `subworkflow_completed` events:

```yaml
parallel:
  - name: plan_issues
    for_each:
      source: epic_planner.output.issues
      as: issue
    max_concurrent: 1
    agent:
      type: workflow
      workflow: ./plan-and-review.yaml
      input_mapping:
        work_item_id: "{{ issue.id }}"
        title: "{{ issue.title }}"
```

**Restrictions** — workflow steps cannot have `prompt`, `model`, `provider`, `tools`, `system_prompt`, `command`, or `options`.

### Terminate Steps

Terminate steps end the workflow with an explicit `status` (`success` or `failed`) and a structured `reason`. Reaching a terminate step ends execution immediately — no routes are evaluated after — and produces a CLI exit code, dashboard state, and event payload that downstream tooling can distinguish from a generic crash.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: precheck
    type: script
    command: bash
    args: ["-c", "echo '{\"action\":\"abort\",\"reason\":\"unsafe input\"}'"]
    output:
      action:  { type: string }
      reason:  { type: string }
    routes:
      - when: "action == 'abort'"
        to: abort_unsafe
      - when: "action == 'noop'"
        to: noop_exit
      - to: main_pipeline

  # Soft success — workflow ends cleanly, exit 0, dashboard ✅.
  - name: noop_exit
    type: terminate
    status: success
    reason: "Document already up to date; no edits needed."

  # Hard failure with reason — workflow ends, exit 1, dashboard ❌.
  - name: abort_unsafe
    type: terminate
    status: failed
    reason: "{{ precheck.output.reason }}"
    output_template:                  # optional; replaces workflow.output
      aborted: "true"                 # rendered then JSON-coerced to True
      stage: precheck
      reason: "{{ precheck.output.reason }}"
```

**Behaviour**

| `status` | CLI exit code | Dashboard | Event | Resumable? |
|----------|---------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| `success` | `0` | ✅ | `workflow_completed { termination_reason, terminated_by, is_explicit: true, status: "success" }` | n/a (clean exit) |
| `failed`  | `1` | ❌ | `workflow_failed { error_type: "WorkflowTerminated", termination_reason, terminated_by, is_explicit: true, status: "failed", output }` | **No** — explicit terminations skip the on-failure checkpoint |

**Final output** — when `output_template:` is set, it *replaces* the workflow-level `output:` mapping for this termination path. Each rendered value is passed through the same JSON-coercion helper used elsewhere in the engine, so `"true"` becomes `True`, `"42"` becomes `42`, and JSON literals are parsed. When `output_template:` is omitted, the workflow-level `output:` is rendered as on any other terminal path.

**Restrictions** — terminate steps cannot have `routes`, `tools`, `output`, `prompt`, `model`, `provider`, `system_prompt`, `command`, `args`, `env`, `working_dir`, `timeout`, `timeout_seconds`, `max_session_seconds`, `max_agent_iterations`, `max_depth`, `retry`, `dialog`, `reasoning`, `workflow`, `input_mapping`, or `options`. They cannot appear as members of a parallel group or as a `for_each` inline agent — route to them from those groups' `routes:` instead.

**Sub-workflow boundary** — a `status: failed` terminate inside a sub-workflow is downgraded to a `SubworkflowTerminatedError` (subclass of `ExecutionError`) at the parent boundary so the parent treats it as a normal sub-workflow failure (its own `workflow_failed` does NOT inherit `is_explicit: true`). The child's rendered output, reason, and terminate step name are preserved on the wrapper as `terminated_output`, `terminated_reason`, and `terminated_by` for `on_error` hooks and debugging surfaces. A `status: success` terminate inside a sub-workflow returns its rendered output cleanly and the parent continues with its next routes.

See [`examples/terminate.yaml`](../examples/terminate.yaml) for a complete worked example with all three paths.

### Dialog Mode

Dialog mode allows agents to conditionally pause after execution and enter a free-form conversation with the user. An LLM evaluator examines the agent's output against user-defined criteria and decides whether to initiate a dialog.

```yaml
agents:
  - name: researcher
    prompt: "Research the given topic thoroughly"
    dialog:
      trigger_prompt: |
        Enter dialog if the agent expresses uncertainty about
        the user's intent, encounters ambiguous requirements,
        or needs clarification before proceeding.
    routes:
      - to: writer
```

When triggered, the user is presented with a choice:
1. **Discuss** — engage in a multi-turn conversation with the agent
2. **Do your best and continue** — skip the dialog and let the agent proceed

After the conversation, the agent re-executes with the dialog transcript as additional context, producing a refined output.

**Configuration:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `dialog.trigger_prompt` | string | Yes | Criteria for the LLM evaluator to decide when dialog is needed |

**Behavior notes:**
- Dialog is supported on regular `agent` type only (not `human_gate`, `script`, or `workflow`)
- In web dashboard mode, the dialog temporarily replaces the graph area with a chat interface
- When `--skip-gates` is set (e.g., CI/automation), dialogs are automatically skipped
- The evaluator prompt should describe *when* to trigger dialog, not *what* to ask — the evaluator generates the opening question from the agent's output context
- After dialog, the agent sees the full conversation transcript and produces updated output

## Parallel Groups

Parallel groups execute multiple agents concurrently for improved performance.

### Static Parallel Groups

Execute a fixed list of agents in parallel:

```yaml
parallel:
  - name: string                    # Required: Group identifier
    description: string             # Optional: Purpose description
    
    agents:                         # Required: Agents to run in parallel
      - agent_name_1
      - agent_name_2
      - agent_name_3
    
    failure_mode: fail_fast         # Required: Error handling strategy
                                    # Options: fail_fast | continue_on_error | all_or_nothing
    
    routes:                         # Optional: Routes after parallel execution
      - to: next_agent
        when: "{{ condition }}"
```

### Dynamic Parallel (For-Each) Groups

Execute an agent template for each item in an array determined at runtime:

```yaml
for_each:
  - name: string                    # Required: Group identifier
    type: for_each                  # Required: Marks this as for-each group
    description: string             # Optional: Purpose description
    
    source: string                  # Required: Reference to array in context
                                    # Example: "finder.output.items"
    
    as: string                      # Required: Loop variable name
                                    # Available in templates as {{ <var> }}
                                    # Reserved names: workflow, context, output, _index, _key
    
    agent:                          # Required: Inline agent definition

        Process {{ item }}
        Index: {{ _index }}         # Zero-based item index
        {% if _key is defined %}
        Key: {{ _key }}             # Extracted key (if key_by specified)
        {% endif %}
      output:                       # Optional: Output schema

    failure_mode: fail_fast         # Optional: Error handling strategy
                                    # Default: fail_fast
    
    key_by: string                  # Optional: Path for dict-based outputs
                                    # Example: "item.id" → outputs["123"]
    
    routes:                         # Optional: Routes after execution
      - to: next_agent
```

**Loop Variables:**

For-each agents have access to special loop variables in addition to the custom loop variable defined by `as`:

- `{{ <var_name> }}` - Current item from array (e.g., `{{ kpi }}`, `{{ item }}`)
- `{{ _index }}` - Zero-based index of current item (0, 1, 2, ...)
- `{{ _key }}` - Extracted key value (only if `key_by` is specified)

**Reserved Variable Names:**

The following names cannot be used for the `as` parameter:
- `workflow` - Reserved for workflow inputs
- `context` - Reserved for execution metadata
- `output` - Reserved for agent outputs
- `_index` - Reserved for item index
- `_key` - Reserved for extracted key

### Failure Modes

- **`fail_fast`** (recommended): Stop immediately on first agent failure
- **`continue_on_error`**: Run all agents; proceed if at least one succeeds
- **`all_or_nothing`**: Run all agents; fail if any agent fails

### Accessing Parallel Outputs

Downstream agents can access parallel group outputs using Jinja2 templates:

#### Static Parallel Groups

```yaml
agents:
  - name: summarizer
    prompt: |
      Summarize the research findings:
      
      Web research: {{ parallel_researchers.outputs.web_researcher.summary }}
      Academic research: {{ parallel_researchers.outputs.academic_researcher.summary }}
      News research: {{ parallel_researchers.outputs.news_researcher.summary }}
```

Structure:
- `{{ group_name.outputs.agent_name.field }}` - Access successful agent output
- `{{ group_name.errors.agent_name.message }}` - Access error details (if `continue_on_error` mode)

#### For-Each Groups

```yaml
agents:
  - name: aggregator
    prompt: |
      Process these results:
      
      # Index-based access (when key_by not specified)
      First result: {{ processors.outputs[0].result }}
      Second result: {{ processors.outputs[1].result }}
      
      # Key-based access (when key_by is specified)
      KPI-123 result: {{ analyzers.outputs["KPI-123"].analysis }}
      
      # Iterate over all outputs
      {% for result in processors.outputs %}
      - {{ result | json }}
      {% endfor %}
      
      # Access loop metadata
      Total processed: {{ processors.outputs | length }}
      
      # Check for errors
      {% if processors.errors %}
      Failed items: {{ processors.errors | length }}
      {% endif %}
```

Structure:
- **Without `key_by`**: `{{ group_name.outputs[index].field }}` - Array access
- **With `key_by`**: `{{ group_name.outputs["key"].field }}` - Dict access
- `{{ group_name.errors }}` - Dict of failed items (if `continue_on_error` or `all_or_nothing`)

## Routes

Routes define workflow control flow. Routes are evaluated in order, and the first matching route is taken.

### Basic Route

```yaml
routes:
  - to: next_agent                  # Agent name or $end
```

### Conditional Route

```yaml
routes:
  - to: approver
    when: "{{ quality_score >= 8 }}"
  - to: reviser
    when: "{{ quality_score < 8 }}"
  - to: $end                        # Default fallback
```

### Route Expressions

Routes support Jinja2 templates and simpleeval expressions:

```yaml
# Jinja2 syntax (recommended)
when: "{{ agent.output.status == 'success' }}"
when: "{{ agent.output.score > 5 and agent.output.valid }}"

# simpleeval syntax (legacy)
when: "status == 'success'"
when: "score > 5 and valid"
```

### Special Destinations

- `$end` - Terminate workflow successfully
- Agent names must match an existing agent or parallel group name

## Inputs and Outputs

### Workflow Inputs

Define expected inputs in the `input` section:

```yaml
input:
  question:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: "The question to answer"
  
  context:
    type: string
    required: false
    default: "No additional context provided"
```

Access in agents: `{{ workflow.input.question }}`

**Optional inputs without an explicit `default`** resolve to type-appropriate zero values rather than `None`, so templates render cleanly:

| Input `type` | Zero value |
|---|---|
| `string` | `""` |
| `number` | `0` |
| `boolean` | `false` |
| `array` | `[]` |
| `object` | `{}` |

This means `{{ workflow.input.optional_msg | default("fallback") }}` correctly renders `"fallback"` when `optional_msg` is omitted, instead of the literal string `"None"`.

### Workflow Metadata Variables

In addition to `workflow.input.*`, every agent has access to:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `workflow.name` | Workflow name from the YAML |
| `workflow.description` | Workflow description from the YAML |
| `workflow.dir` | Absolute path to the directory containing the workflow YAML |
| `workflow.file` | Absolute path to the workflow YAML file |

These are available in **all** context modes (they're metadata, not inputs). `workflow.dir` is particularly useful for registry-hosted workflows that need to reference co-located scripts or assets without depending on the caller's working directory:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: detector
    type: script
    command: pwsh
    args:
      - "-File"
      - "{{ workflow.dir }}/scripts/detect-state.ps1"
```

### Workflow Outputs

Define the final workflow output:

```yaml
output:
  answer: "{{ answerer.output.answer }}"
  confidence: "{{ answerer.output.confidence }}"
  sources: "{{ researcher.output.sources }}"
```

### Agent Outputs

Define expected output schema for validation:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: analyzer
    output:
      score:
        type: number
        description: "Quality score 1-10"
      summary:
        type: string
        description: "Brief summary"
      recommendations:
        type: array
        description: "List of recommendations"
```

## Limits and Safety

Configure safety limits to prevent runaway workflows:

```yaml
workflow:
  limits:
    max_iterations: 50              # Maximum agent executions (1-500, default: 10)
    timeout_seconds: 1800           # Maximum wall-clock time in seconds (optional)
```

### Iteration Counting

- Each agent execution counts as 1 iteration
- Parallel agents count individually (3 parallel agents = 3 iterations)
- Loop-back patterns increment the counter on each iteration

### Timeout Behavior

- Workflow terminates when `timeout_seconds` is exceeded
- Includes all agent execution time and overhead
- `None` (default) means no timeout

## Tools

Tools can be configured at workflow or agent level.

### Workflow-level Tools

Available to all agents:

```yaml
tools:
  - web_search
  - calculator
```

### Agent-level Tools

Override or extend workflow tools:

```yaml
agents:
  - name: researcher
    tools:
      - web_search
      - arxiv_search
```

**Note**: Tool implementation depends on your provider. See provider documentation for available tools.

### MCP Servers

Tools are typically provided by [MCP servers](mcp-tools.md) configured in the `workflow.runtime.mcp_servers` section. MCP tools are automatically made available to agents and can be filtered using the `tools` field above.

```yaml
workflow:
  runtime:
    mcp_servers:
      web-search:
        command: npx
        args: ["-y", "open-websearch@latest"]
        tools: ["*"]

agents:
  - name: researcher
    tools:
      - web-search__search    # Use specific MCP tool (server__tool format)
    prompt: "Research the topic"
```

For full MCP configuration details, see the [MCP Tools guide](mcp-tools.md).

## External File References

The `!file` YAML tag lets you reference external files from any YAML field value. The file content is transparently inlined during loading, keeping workflow files concise and enabling reuse of prompts, schemas, and configuration across workflows.

### Syntax

Use the `!file` tag followed by a file path:

```yaml
field_name: !file path/to/file
```

The tag can be used on any scalar YAML value — string fields, output schemas, tool lists, or any other field.

### Content-Type Detection

The content of the referenced file is handled based on its structure:

- **YAML dict or list** — If the file content parses as a YAML mapping or sequence, it is returned as structured data (dict or list). This is useful for output schemas, tool lists, or any structured configuration.
- **Scalar or non-YAML** — If the file contains a YAML scalar (e.g., a plain string), is not valid YAML, or is a non-YAML format like Markdown, the raw file content is returned as a string.

### Path Resolution

File paths are resolved **relative to the directory containing the YAML file** that uses the `!file` tag, not relative to the current working directory.

```
project/
├── workflows/
│   └── review.yaml        # prompt: !file ../prompts/review.md
├── prompts/
│   └── review.md           # ← resolved relative to workflows/
└── schemas/
    └── output.yaml
```

When using `load_string()` programmatically:
- If `source_path` is provided, paths resolve relative to `source_path.parent`
- If `source_path` is not provided, paths resolve relative to the current working directory

### Usage Examples

#### Prompt from a Markdown File

Keep long prompts in separate Markdown files for easier editing:

```yaml
# workflow.yaml
agents:
  - name: reviewer
    model: gpt-4
    prompt: !file prompts/review-prompt.md
    routes:
      - to: $end
```

```markdown
# prompts/review-prompt.md
You are a code review expert.

Please analyze the following code and provide:
- A summary of what the code does
- Any bugs or issues found
- Suggestions for improvement
```

#### Structured Output Schema from YAML

Extract output schemas into reusable files:

```yaml
# workflow.yaml
agents:
  - name: analyzer
    model: gpt-4
    prompt: "Analyze the input data"
    output: !file schemas/analysis-output.yaml
    routes:
      - to: $end
```

```yaml
# schemas/analysis-output.yaml
summary:
  type: string
  description: A brief summary of the analysis
score:
  type: number
  description: A confidence score from 1 to 10
```

#### Tool List from External File

Share tool configurations across agents:

```yaml
# workflow.yaml
agents:
  - name: researcher
    model: gpt-4
    prompt: "Research the topic"
    tools: !file tools/research-tools.yaml
    routes:
      - to: $end
```

```yaml
# tools/research-tools.yaml
- web_search
- arxiv_search
- calculator
```

#### Nested Inclusion

Included YAML files can themselves contain `!file` tags. Each nested reference resolves relative to its own file's directory:

```yaml
# workflow.yaml
agents:
  - name: agent1
    model: gpt-4
    prompt: "Hello"
    output: !file schemas/nested.yaml
    routes:
      - to: $end
```

```yaml
# schemas/nested.yaml
summary:
  type: string
  description: !file ../descriptions/summary-desc.md
```

```markdown
# descriptions/summary-desc.md
A comprehensive summary of the analysis results.
```

### Environment Variables

Environment variable references (`${VAR}` or `${VAR:-default}`) inside included files are resolved after inclusion, during the standard environment variable resolution pass. This means you can use env vars in external files just as you would inline:

```markdown
# prompts/greeting.md
Hello ${USER_NAME:-User}, welcome to the system.
```

### Error Handling

#### Missing Files

If a referenced file does not exist, a `ConfigurationError` is raised with the file path and a suggestion:

```
ConfigurationError: File not found: 'prompts/missing.md' (resolved to '/absolute/path/prompts/missing.md')
  💡 Suggestion: Check the file path is correct relative to the workflow file directory.
```

#### Circular References

If `!file` tags form a cycle (e.g., file A includes file B which includes file A), a `ConfigurationError` is raised:

```
ConfigurationError: Circular file reference detected: 'a.yaml'
  File inclusion chain: /path/main.yaml → /path/a.yaml → /path/b.yaml → /path/a.yaml
  💡 Suggestion: Remove the circular !file reference.
```

#### Encoding Errors

Only UTF-8 text files are supported. Non-UTF-8 files produce a `ConfigurationError` with encoding guidance.

### Limitations

- **UTF-8 only** — Only UTF-8 encoded text files are supported
- **No glob patterns** — Wildcards like `!file prompts/*.md` are not supported
- **No URLs** — Remote references like `!file https://...` are not supported
- **No conditional includes** — File references cannot be parameterized or conditional
- **No caching** — Each `!file` reference reads the file independently

## Hooks

Lifecycle hooks execute template expressions at key workflow events:

```yaml
workflow:
  hooks:
    on_start: "{{ 'Starting workflow: ' + workflow.name }}"
    on_complete: "{{ 'Workflow completed in ' + str(workflow.execution_time) + 's' }}"
    on_error: "{{ 'Workflow failed: ' + workflow.error.message }}"
```

### Available Hook Contexts

**`on_start`**:
- `workflow.name`, `workflow.description`, `workflow.dir`, `workflow.file`
- `workflow.input.*` (all input values)

**`on_complete`**:
- All agent outputs
- `workflow.execution_time` (total seconds)
- `workflow.iteration_count` (total iterations)

**`on_error`**:
- `workflow.error.message` (error message)
- `workflow.error.agent` (agent that failed)
- Partial agent outputs (agents that completed before failure)
